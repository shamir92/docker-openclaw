# OpenClaw + Caddy + Cloudflare (Access / trusted-proxy auth)

Self-hosted OpenClaw gateway behind Caddy, with Cloudflare DNS (proxied/orange),
TLS via a **Cloudflare Origin Certificate**, and authentication delegated to
**Cloudflare Access** using OpenClaw's **trusted-proxy** auth model.

```
Browser
  │  (user logs in via Cloudflare Access: Google / GitHub / one-time PIN)
  ▼
Cloudflare edge ──► injects  Cf-Access-Authenticated-User-Email
  │
  ▼  (:443, firewalled to Cloudflare IPs only)
Caddy  ──► maps that email to  X-Forwarded-User
  │        + auto-sets X-Forwarded-Proto / X-Forwarded-Host
  ▼  (internal docker network 172.28.0.0/24)
OpenClaw gateway :18789
        auth.mode = trusted-proxy, trustedProxies = [Caddy IP]
```

Files in this folder:

| Path | What it is |
|------|------------|
| `docker-compose.yml` | Caddy (stock `caddy:2`) + OpenClaw gateway on an isolated bridge network |
| `caddy/Dockerfile` | Optional — only for the Let's Encrypt DNS-01 alternative (not used by default) |
| `caddy/Caddyfile` | TLS (Origin cert) + reverse proxy + Access→header mapping |
| `caddy/certs/` | Drop your Cloudflare Origin cert (`origin.pem`) + key (`origin-key.pem`) here |
| `.env.example` | Just your domain (no API token needed with Origin cert) |
| `openclaw/config/openclaw.gateway-snippet.json` | The `gateway` block to merge into the generated config |
| `scripts/lock-origin-to-cloudflare.sh` | Firewall the origin to Cloudflare IPs (**required**) |

Replace `openclaw.example.com` / `you@example.com` everywhere with your real values.

## 0. Prerequisites (Ubuntu 26.04)

```bash
# Docker Engine + Compose v2
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
sudo usermod -aG docker "$USER"   # log out/in afterwards

# Copy this folder to the server, then:
cd openclaw-caddy
cp .env.example .env
$EDITOR .env                       # set DOMAIN
```

---

## 1. Cloudflare DNS

In the Cloudflare dashboard for your zone → **DNS → Records**:

- Add an **A** record: `openclaw` → your server's public IPv4.
- **Proxy status: Proxied (orange cloud).**

Then **SSL/TLS → Overview → set encryption mode to `Full (strict)`.**
(Caddy will hold a Cloudflare Origin cert, which `Full (strict)` validates.)
Also enable **SSL/TLS → Edge Certificates → Always Use HTTPS**.

## 2. Cloudflare Origin Certificate (for the Cloudflare→Caddy leg)

**SSL/TLS → Origin Server → Create Certificate:**

1. Leave "Generate private key and CSR with Cloudflare" selected.
2. Hostnames: `openclaw.example.com` (or `*.example.com`).
3. Validity: up to 15 years → **Create**.
4. You'll be shown two PEM blocks (the key is shown **only once**):
   - **Origin Certificate** → save to `caddy/certs/origin.pem`
   - **Private Key** → save to `caddy/certs/origin-key.pem`

```bash
mkdir -p caddy/certs
$EDITOR caddy/certs/origin.pem       # paste the Origin Certificate
$EDITOR caddy/certs/origin-key.pem   # paste the Private Key
chmod 600 caddy/certs/origin-key.pem
```

No API token is required for this method.

## 3. Cloudflare Access (Zero Trust) — this is the "auth"

**Zero Trust dashboard → Access → Applications → Add an application → Self-hosted:**

1. **Application domain:** `openclaw.example.com`
2. **Identity providers:** enable at least one (Google, GitHub, or One-time PIN).
3. **Policies →** Add a policy:
   - Action: **Allow**
   - Include → **Emails** → the address(es) allowed in (e.g. `you@example.com`).
4. Save. (Optional: note the **Application Audience (AUD) tag** under the app's
   Overview — needed only if you later add JWT validation, see Hardening.)

> Access now sits in front of the hostname. Every request is authenticated at
> Cloudflare's edge before it ever reaches your server, and Cloudflare injects
> the `Cf-Access-Authenticated-User-Email` header that Caddy forwards.

## 4. Prepare local directories & permissions

The gateway container runs as uid **1000** (`node`), so bind-mounted dirs must
be owned by it:

```bash
mkdir -p openclaw/config openclaw/secret caddy/data caddy/config
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 openclaw/config openclaw/secret
```

## 5. First start (generate default config)

Bring up the gateway once so it writes a default `openclaw.json`:

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f openclaw-gateway    # watch until it's serving on :18789, then Ctrl-C
```

## 6. Enable trusted-proxy auth

Merge the `gateway` block from `openclaw/config/openclaw.gateway-snippet.json`
into the generated `openclaw/config/openclaw.json` (keep any other keys the
gateway already wrote). Edit these values in the snippet first:

- `allowedOrigins`  → `["https://openclaw.example.com"]`
- `allowUsers`      → your Access email(s)
- `trustedProxies`  → keep `["172.28.0.2/32"]` (Caddy's fixed IP from compose)

Then restart and confirm auth mode is active:

```bash
docker compose restart openclaw-gateway
docker compose logs --tail=50 openclaw-gateway   # should show trusted-proxy auth, no token error
```

> If startup errors about a token being set, ensure `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` is
> **not** in your `.env`/environment and `gateway.auth.token` is **not** in
> `openclaw.json` — trusted-proxy mode refuses to run alongside a shared token.

## 7. Lock the origin to Cloudflare (REQUIRED)

Because the gateway trusts a header, an exposed origin = full auth bypass.
Docker bypasses `ufw`, so use the provided script (filters the `DOCKER-USER`
chain):

```bash
sudo bash scripts/lock-origin-to-cloudflare.sh

# also allow SSH from your admin IP and enable ufw for everything else:
sudo ufw allow from <YOUR_ADMIN_IP> to any port 22 proto tcp
sudo ufw --force enable
```

## 8. Verify

```bash
# From a machine that is NOT Cloudflare — should hang/refuse (origin locked):
curl -m 5 -k https://<SERVER_PUBLIC_IP>/ -H "Host: openclaw.example.com" ; echo

# In a browser: https://openclaw.example.com
#   → Cloudflare Access login → after auth, the OpenClaw Control UI loads,
#     already signed in as your email (no gateway token prompt).
```

Add your LLM provider API keys from inside the Control UI once you're in.

## Hardening (recommended, in order of value)

1. **Validate the Access JWT at Caddy**, not just the email header. The email
   header alone is trustworthy *only* because the origin is firewalled to
   Cloudflare. Validating `Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion` against your team's JWKS
   (`https://<team>.cloudflareaccess.com/cdn-cgi/access/certs`) + the app AUD
   removes reliance on the IP allowlist. Requires a Caddy build with a JWT/auth
   plugin (e.g. `caddy-security`).
2. **Cloudflare Tunnel instead of open ports.** Run `cloudflared` pointed at
   Caddy; the origin then has *no* inbound ports at all and only Cloudflare can
   reach it — this removes the DOCKER-USER firewall complexity entirely and is
   arguably the cleaner design. Say the word and I'll convert this stack to it.
3. **Authenticated Origin Pulls** (mTLS from Cloudflare to your origin) as an
   alternative/additional origin lock.
4. **Pin the OpenClaw image** to a version tag instead of `latest`.
5. `docker compose run --rm --entrypoint openclaw openclaw-gateway security audit`
   — note: this intentionally reports trusted-proxy auth as a *critical* finding
   to remind you that security depends on the proxy/firewall in front.

## Notes & gotchas

- **WebSockets:** the Control UI uses WS; Cloudflare proxied + Access + Caddy
  all pass WebSockets through by default. `allowedOrigins` must exactly match
  your `https://` origin or the WS handshake is rejected.
- **`bind: "all"`** makes the gateway listen on its container interface so Caddy
  can reach it. The port is never published to the host and is firewalled, so
  this is safe here.
- **Origin cert requires the proxy ON** — a Cloudflare Origin cert is trusted
  only by Cloudflare, so it works precisely because your record is proxied
  (orange). This is the same proxy setting Access needs, so they align.
  Cloudflare SSL mode **must** be `Full (strict)` (not Flexible — Flexible would
  talk plain HTTP to your origin and break the `tls` directive).
- **Adding users later:** add their email to the Cloudflare Access policy *and*
  to `allowUsers` in `openclaw.json` (or leave `allowUsers` empty to accept any
  Access-authenticated user).
